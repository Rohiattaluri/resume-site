ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is a personal resume website created as part of ITMD 541 â€“ Lab 1. The website is designed using only HTML and CSS (no JavaScript) and deployed via GitHub Pages.

It highlights my academic background, professional experience, technical skills, and projects in a clean, modern, and mobile-friendly design. A professional profile photo and polished layout make the site suitable for sharing with recruiters and future employers.

The project demonstrates my ability to:

Build structured web pages with semantic HTML5

Style layouts with modern CSS (Flexbox, responsive design, Google Fonts)

Apply design principles to create an elegant and professional webpage

Use GitHub for version control and hosting through GitHub Pages

This site serves as both a course deliverable and a professional digital resume that I can update and maintain beyond this class.
