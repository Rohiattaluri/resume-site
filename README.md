This project is a responsive, professional resume website built entirely with HTML5 and CSS3, following semantic and accessible design principles. It was developed as part of ITMD 541 â€“ Lab 1 to demonstrate skills in modern front-end web development, version control, and deployment practices.

The website showcases my academic journey, technical skills, industry experience, and key projects in a clean and elegant layout. It emphasizes professionalism by integrating a profile photo, structured sections, and consistent typography through Google Fonts.

Key highlights of the project:

ðŸ“± Responsive Design â†’ Optimized for both desktop and mobile using flexible layouts and CSS media queries.

ðŸŽ¨ Professional Styling â†’ Modern typography, color themes, and a clean layout suitable for recruiters and employers.

ðŸ§© Semantic HTML Structure â†’ Utilization of semantic tags (header, section, footer) for improved accessibility and readability.

ðŸš€ Version Control & Hosting â†’ Managed through GitHub with frequent commits and deployed via GitHub Pages.

ðŸ“‚ Content Depth â†’ Includes detailed sections: About Me, Education (Masters & Bachelors), Skills, Work Experience, and Projects (with advanced real-world implementations such as Banking System, Intrusion Detection System for IoV, and Expense Tracking App).

This site not only fulfills academic requirements but also serves as a living digital resume that can be continuously updated to reflect my career progress, technical expertise, and project portfolio.
